# SpeechRecognition
Speech recognition in android is a very first thing that we want now a days because Artificial Intelligence is everywhere.
I am extending the work from reconizing the text from speech and convert them into ones native language and finally perfrom the task.


I jave implemented this with the help of firebase ml kit language identification feature.You may find the link here 
https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/identify-languages


Following is a short description about firebase language identification process:
With ML Kit's on-device language identification API, you can determine the language of a string of text.
Language identification can be useful when working with user-provided text, which often doesn't come with any language information.


You may find the github link of ML Kit Language ID for Firebase Quickstart from here :

My future works with this:

1.Add search or web search regarding to what user saying.
2.Predict or find the probability of negative or positive value of that words that user is saying.
